# Job Journal

Job journal is a simple Sinatra application that allows you to keep track of the jobs you find interesting. You can record the name of the company, position title, job description or notes you have about the job, and the date you applied. You can leave that last one blank if you have not applied yet and want to just record the job!


## Installation
To install you will have to clone this repo and run ```bundle install``` in the terminal. Run ```shotgun``` to start the local session. You should see something like:

```ruby
== Shotgun/Thin on http://127.0.0.1:9393/
Thin web server (v1.7.2 codename Bachmanity)
Maximum connections set to 1024
Listening on 127.0.0.1:9393, CTRL+C to stop
```

You can copy and paste the numbers in ```listening``` like this ```127.0.0.1:9393``` or this```localhost:9393``` in the url bar of a new tab. All of your changes in your program will reflect in the session.

### Prereqs
You should have ruby installed on your machine and some way to run the code like a local environment or browser IDE.
